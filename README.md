The Manga Translator is a tool that automates the translation of manga text from its original language into the reader's desired language. Using advanced OCR, inpainting, and machine translation, it detects and removes original text, translates it, and re-embeds the translated text back into the manga panel, preserving the artworkâ€™s quality.
